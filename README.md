# Parameterized Circular Saw Guide

This is a parameterized model for a circular saw guide that I created as an exercise in parametric design with OpenSCAD. This is a work in progress and will change as I go through the build.

I have been targeting the Ryobi P508 cordless brushless saw for this design, but I have tested rendering the design with rough specifications for saws with different dimensions. Below are side-by-side comparisons of the outputs for the following saws:

* Left: Makita 5402NA 15-5/16" saw
* Middle: Ryobi P508 7-1/4" saw
* Right: WORX WX429L 4-1/2" saw
